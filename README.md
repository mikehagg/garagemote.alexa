# Integrate LowPowerLab IoT Gateway GarageMote to be controlled via Amazon Echo Devices

## Project Summary:

This project enables the LowPowerLab GarageMote to be controlled via an Amazon Echo device.  I extended the IoT Gateway created by Felix Rusu (see Links below) to allow an Amazon Echo "Alexa" device to control the GarageMote.

## Details

In order to implement this project you should have an existing GarageMote operating via a LowPowerLab IoT Gateway.  To fully implement you will need to:
* Set up AWS IoT "Thing"
** Link to a certificate and ensure you have saved private, public and root files
* Set up an Alexa Skill at developer.amazon.com
** Sample Invocation, Intent and Slots Interaction model JSON in alexa folder
* Modify LowPowerLab metrics.js file
** TODO: figure out how to present diff in Github
